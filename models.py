# todo add RobotQueue model
# RobotQueue will be a table that holds references to files containing synthesis steps.
# For now those files will be JSON, but in the future they will be XDL.
# When a robot sends a GET request to the server, the server will check the queue table to see what the
# earliest (MIN(QUEUE_NUM)) entry for that ROBOT_ID is. If a record is found, the app must delete that
# record from the table after retrieving it.
#  on that, the flask app will look for the
# FILE_NAME in the filesystem and send that file to the robot.
# COL 1: ROBOT_ID, COL2: QUEUE_NUM, COL3: FILE_NAME
